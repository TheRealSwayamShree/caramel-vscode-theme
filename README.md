# Caramel Theme for VSCode

The **Caramel Theme** is a meticulously crafted color scheme for Visual Studio Code, inspired by warm, earthy tones. It combines soft, muted accents with harmonious contrasts to create a visually appealing and highly functional palette. Designed with accessibility in mind, the Caramel Theme complies with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards to ensure readability and usability for all users.

## Features
- **Two Variants**: Includes both **Caramel Dark** and **Caramel Light** to suit different preferences and environments.
- **Accessibility**: Carefully selected colors prioritize contrast and readability, making it suitable for users with visual impairments and varied lighting conditions.
- **Balanced Palette**: The theme's muted tones reduce eye strain while maintaining aesthetic appeal.
